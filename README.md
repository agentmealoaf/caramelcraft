# CaramelCraft

> CaramelCraft is an open source building resource pack to enhance your Minecraft experience. I've been working on it for about 6 months, so it's still in its early stages, but I hope you all enjoy.

## Usage

> CaramelCraft currently supports Minecraft 1.15.1, when OptiFine is updated, I will look into supporting OF features.

## Releases

> Full versions of the pack will be avaliable here as well on **[CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/caramelcraft)**

---

> Development versions are available exclusive through github, I do my best to release updates every Sunday.
